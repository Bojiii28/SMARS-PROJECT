## üìù Introduction

The **SMARS (Screwless Modular Assemblable Robotic System)** project demonstrates creativity in robotics and DIY electronics.  

Built on Arduino, SMARS is a modular mini-robot that requires **no screws** for assembly. Its design allows easy customization and autonomous functions, like obstacle avoidance, making it a perfect learning platform for beginners and hobbyists.  

**Key Goals:**  
- Learn modular assembly techniques  
- Integrate sensors and motor control  
- Program autonomous behavior using Arduino

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure

1. Insert batteries correctly into the holder  
2. Place the robot on a flat, stable surface  
3. Turn on the switch to power the robot  

Once powered, the robot moves autonomously, detects obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor, and turns to avoid collisions.
