## Introduction

The **SMARS (Screwless Modular Assemblable Robotic System)** project demonstrates creativity in robotics and DIY electronics.  

Built on Arduino, SMARS is a modular mini-robot that requires **no screws** for assembly. Its design allows easy customization and autonomous functions, like obstacle avoidance, making it a perfect learning platform for beginners and hobbyists.  

**Key Goals:**  
- Learn modular assembly techniques.  
- Integrate sensors and motor control.  
- Program autonomous behavior using Arduino.

## Procedure

1. Insert batteries correctly into the holder.  
2. Place the mini tank on a flat, stable surface.  
3. Turn on the switch to power the robot.  

The robot will start moving and automatically detect obstacles, turning randomly to avoid collisions.
